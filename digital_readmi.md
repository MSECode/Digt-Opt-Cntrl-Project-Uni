# Balacing a cart-model robot

## Summary

This project was developed as part of the course of Digital and Optimal controls at Aalto University.

Basically, the project consists of the task of balancing a cart-model robot starting from a simple PID control approach and leading, at the end, with a more complet model made of state observer and Linear Quadraic Regulator (LQR) controller.

## Explanation of the project

**Brief explanation of the sections**

The project was divided into three main parts:

- **Laboratory A**: Static and dynamic analysis of the robot model. Linearized equation of morion and space-state (SS) model. PID design and disturbances modelling.
- **Laboratory B**: Calibration and State Observer designing. Defined the full and reduced Luenberger observers.
- **Laboratory C**: Complete discretization of the model. LQR approach for controller and final testing.

**Detailed explanation**

### Laboratory A

In order to obtain the Equations of Motion (EOM) the static and dynamic analysis was perormed using the model of the robot shown below.
